**Nōṭṭu svarams** were first documented in print by **C. P. Brown** in
1833. In 1893, **Manālī Chinnaswamy Mudaliar** published them with
European notation, and in 1905, they were compiled in Telugu by
**Subbarāma Dīkṣitar** as *Prathamābhāya pustakamu*.

These are called *jāti svarams*. ***Gamakams***(dynamic frequency
shifts, typical to Carnatic music) do not occur specifically in these.

All the Nōṭṭu svarams are in ***śaṅkarābharaṅa rāgam***.

**Gati** is the number of *mātras*, corresponding to the ***measures***
in a ***beat*** in Western Music. **Nōṭṭu svarams** are formulated to be
in *tiśra gati*(3/4 in Western Notation) or *caturaśra gati*(4/4 or 4/8
in Western Notation).

Dhīraśankarābharaṇaṃ
---------------------

**Dhīraśankarābharaṇaṃ**, also commonly known as **śaṅkarābharaṇaṃ** is
a ***Mēḷakarta rāga***(parent rāga, from which other rāgas may be
gnerated) in the 72 *Mēḷakarta rāga* system of Carnatic Music.
Mellifluous and smooth by nature, this rāga is ideal for a melodious but
still a laid back majestic presentation.

Scale-wise, the śaṅkarābharaṇaṃ scale corresponds to the Western **Major
Scale**, or the ***Ionian Mode***. This is the prime reason why many
European/Colonial songs could be expressed in this rāgam.

Rhythmic Structure
-------------------

Unlike most of Indian Classical melodies, Nōṭṭusvarams are based on simpler Western Beat Notations, namely the **Metric Structure**. In a *Metrical Rhythm*, each time value is a multiple or a fraction of a fixed unit(beat), and normal accents reoccur regularly, providing a systematic grouping. A **beat** is a durational pattern which occupies a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level.

### A quadruple metre (caturaśram)

In a **quadruple metre**, each measure is divided into four beats, or a multiple thereof. For example, in the time signature 4/4, each *bar* contains four quarter-note beats per measure.

### A triple metre (tiśram)

**Triple metre** is a metre in which each bar is divided into three beats, or a multiple thereof. For example, in the time signature 3/4, each *bar* contains three quarter-note beats per measure.
