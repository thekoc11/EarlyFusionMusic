In this study, we intend to address the following problems:

- **Bengal:** Explore the relatively unknown influence of Indian popular melodies of the late eighteenth century on the contemporary English musical performances of the time and Hindustani Classical music on the musical imaginations of certain later English composers, both of which lie at the core of British-Indian musical interstices and allow for the tracing and exchange of musical ideas between India and Britain from the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries.
- **South India:** One novel compositional form that emerged during the eighteenth and ninteenth centuries is the Nottusvara. This set of compositions is a fascinating symbol of the musical experiments and syntheses that emerged in eighteenth century South India as a consequence of the interaction of practitioners of indigenous and European music of the time.
- **Computational Approaches:** The problem of determining why only certain European tunes made it to the Carnatic System would also be addressed adopting a mathematical and computational approach. Is structural complexity of such European tunes similar to the Carnatic raagas in which they were adopted?
